# Community Map

An interactive, self-service map showcasing members of your GitHub organization.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your organization;
1. Adjust your community name, description, API key in `_config.yml`;
1. Create an account on geoapify.com, add a project to get an API key, make it a secret on GitHub: Settings / Secrets and variables / Actions / New repository secret.  Name it `GEOAPIFY_KEY`.
1. Make sure your community members are allowed to trigger GitHub actions in your repository so that they can add their location to the map in self-service mode.
